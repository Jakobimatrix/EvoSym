# Random world:
  - 3D
  - start with sphere (see YT video)
  - whats the resolution?
    - can be height, needs to be calculated once, but rendered only if necessary
    - render depending on view, if weather needs it for calculation, if animal is there 
  - random height use perlian noise, different sizes
  - set random area types according to longitude
  - use "hydraulik errosion"-forming" (see YT video) strength according to area type, --> form lakes (rivers?)
    - dont do hydrahydraulik errosionn in ocean
  - calculate weather for some time, change region according weather
  - save world if stable
